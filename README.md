Network Scanner Script:

This script is a command-line tool that can be used to scan a network and identify all available devices. It works by sending a single ping packet to each IP address in a specified range and checking if a response is received.

Usage:

To use the script, save it as a .cmd file and run it from the command prompt. The script will prompt you to enter the starting and ending IP addresses for the range you want to scan. The script will then scan each IP address in the range and print a message for each device found.

C:\> scan_network.cmd

Enter the starting IP address: 192.168.1.1
Enter the ending IP address: 192.168.1.254

Scanning network...

Device found: 192.168.1.1
Device found: 192.168.1.2
Device found: 192.168.1.10
Device found: 192.168.1.100

Notes:

The script may take some time to complete, depending on the size of the range being scanned.
Some devices may not respond to ping requests, so the script may not be able to detect all devices on the network.

Scanning a network without proper authorization may be illegal and can result in serious consequences.

Password Generator:

This is a Python code for a simple password generator that generates a random password of a specified length. The password can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation characters.

Usage:

To use the password generator, simply call the generate_password function with the desired length of the password.

This code uses the following modules:

random
string

This will generate a random password of length 12 and print it to the console. You can change the length to generate passwords of different lengths. The characters string defines the set of characters that can be used in the password; you can modify this string to customize the character set if desired.

Hash Function:

This is a Python script that contains a simple hash function that uses the SHA-256 algorithm from the hashlib module. The hash function takes a string as input and returns the SHA-256 hash of the string in hexadecimal format.

Usage:

To use the hash function, simply call the hash_string function with the string you want to hash. The function will return the SHA-256 hash of the input string in hexadecimal format. Note that the hash function is a one-way function, meaning that it's not possible to retrieve the original string from the hash.

This code uses the following module:

hashlib

Web Scraper:

This is a Python script that demonstrates how to scrape web pages using the requests and beautifulsoup4 modules. The script sends a GET request to a specified URL, extracts information from the HTML content of the response using BeautifulSoup, and prints out the text and href attribute of each link on the page.

Usage:

To use the web scraper, simply call the scrape_url function with the URL of the website you want to scrape. The function will send a GET request to the specified URL, parse the HTML content of the response using BeautifulSoup, and print out the text and href attribute of each link on the page.

Note that scraping websites without permission may be against their terms of service or may be illegal in some jurisdictions. Be sure to obtain the necessary permissions and follow ethical guidelines when using web scrapers.

This code uses the following modules:

requests
beautifulsoup4

Log Analyzer:

This is a Python script that demonstrates how to analyze log files using regular expressions. The script reads a log file, extracts log entries using a regular expression, counts the number of occurrences of each log entry, and prints out the results.

Usage:

To use the log analyzer, simply call the analyze_log_file function with the path to the log file you want to analyze. The function will extract log entries using a regular expression, count the number of occurrences of each log entry, and print out the results.

Note that log files may contain sensitive information, and it is important to handle them with care. Be sure to follow ethical guidelines and data privacy regulations when working with log files.

This code uses the following module:
