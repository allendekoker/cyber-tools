Network Scanner Script:

This script is a command-line tool that can be used to scan a network and identify all available devices. It works by sending a single ping packet to each IP address in a specified range and checking if a response is received.

Usage:

To use the script, save it as a .cmd file and run it from the command prompt. The script will prompt you to enter the starting and ending IP addresses for the range you want to scan. The script will then scan each IP address in the range and print a message for each device found.

C:\> scan_network.cmd

Enter the starting IP address: 192.168.1.1
Enter the ending IP address: 192.168.1.254

Scanning network...

Device found: 192.168.1.1
Device found: 192.168.1.2
Device found: 192.168.1.10
Device found: 192.168.1.100

Notes:

The script may take some time to complete, depending on the size of the range being scanned.
Some devices may not respond to ping requests, so the script may not be able to detect all devices on the network.

Scanning a network without proper authorization may be illegal and can result in serious consequences.

This script tests the strength of passwords based on a set of predefined rules, including minimum length, requirement of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.

To use this script, simply call the "password_strength" function with a password as the argument. The function will return a message indicating whether the password is weak or strong, along with recommendations for how to improve its strength if necessary.

Usage:

Download or clone the password_strength.py file.
Import the password_strength function into your project or script.
Call the password_strength function with a password as the argument.

<!-- Example:

from password_strength import password_strength

password = 'MySecurePassword123!'
result = password_strength(password)
print(result) # output: Password is strong. -->

Customization:

The password strength rules can be customized by editing the rules dictionary in the script. The following rules can be adjusted:

length: minimum password length
lower: password must contain at least one lowercase character
upper: password must contain at least one uppercase character
digit: password must contain at least one digit
special: password must contain at least one special character

Adjusting these rules can help you customize the password strength requirements to your specific needs.

Image-based Authentication Tool:

This tool implements image-based authentication using a specific pattern. The user is required to select some images (such as different trading tool names) in a specific pattern (for example, AAPL is followed by GOOG which is in turn followed by MSFT and so on). The next time the user tries to log in, the images would have been shuffled, but the user will be required to follow the same pattern which was used initially. Every time the user will have to use the same sequence while the images are placed in different ways. This type of authentication is difficult to break since neither brute force nor dictionary attacks could breach it.

Requirements:

    Python 3
    PIL (Python Imaging Library)

Usage:

Clone the repository or download the image-based-authentication.py file.

Modify the tool_names list with your own set of trading tool names.

Run the script using the following command: python image-based-authentication.py

The script will generate a pattern of shuffled trading tool names and display them to the user.

The user should input the trading tool names in the correct order based on the pattern that was generated.

If the user's input matches the original pattern, the authentication is successful.
