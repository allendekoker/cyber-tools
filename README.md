Network Scanner Script:

This script is a command-line tool that can be used to scan a network and identify all available devices. It works by sending a single ping packet to each IP address in a specified range and checking if a response is received.

Usage:

To use the script, save it as a .cmd file and run it from the command prompt. The script will prompt you to enter the starting and ending IP addresses for the range you want to scan. The script will then scan each IP address in the range and print a message for each device found.

C:\> scan_network.cmd

Enter the starting IP address: 192.168.1.1
Enter the ending IP address: 192.168.1.254

Scanning network...

Device found: 192.168.1.1
Device found: 192.168.1.2
Device found: 192.168.1.10
Device found: 192.168.1.100

Notes:

The script may take some time to complete, depending on the size of the range being scanned.
Some devices may not respond to ping requests, so the script may not be able to detect all devices on the network.

Scanning a network without proper authorization may be illegal and can result in serious consequences.

Password Generator:

This is a Python code for a simple password generator that generates a random password of a specified length. The password can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation characters.

Usage:

To use the password generator, simply call the "generate_password" function with the desired length of the password.

This code uses the following modules:

"random"
"string"

This will generate a random password of length 12 and print it to the console. You can change the length to generate passwords of different lengths. The characters string defines the set of characters that can be used in the password; you can modify this string to customize the character set if desired.

Hash Function:

This is a Python script that contains a simple hash function that uses the SHA-256 algorithm from the hashlib module. The hash function takes a string as input and returns the SHA-256 hash of the string in hexadecimal format.

Usage:

To use the hash function, simply call the "hash_string" function with the string you want to hash. The function will return the SHA-256 hash of the input string in hexadecimal format. Note that the hash function is a one-way function, meaning that it's not possible to retrieve the original string from the hash.

This code uses the following module:

"hashlib"

Web Scraper:

This is a Python script that demonstrates how to scrape web pages using the requests and beautifulsoup4 modules. The script sends a GET request to a specified URL, extracts information from the HTML content of the response using BeautifulSoup, and prints out the text and href attribute of each link on the page.

Usage:

To use the web scraper, simply call the "scrape_url" function with the URL of the website you want to scrape. The function will send a GET request to the specified URL, parse the HTML content of the response using BeautifulSoup, and print out the text and href attribute of each link on the page.

Note that scraping websites without permission may be against their terms of service or may be illegal in some jurisdictions. Be sure to obtain the necessary permissions and follow ethical guidelines when using web scrapers.

This code uses the following modules:

"requests"
"beautifulsoup4"

Log Analyzer:

This is a Python script that demonstrates how to analyze log files using regular expressions. The script reads a log file, extracts log entries using a regular expression, counts the number of occurrences of each log entry, and prints out the results.

Usage:

To use the log analyzer, simply call the "analyze_log_file" function with the path to the log file you want to analyze. The function will extract log entries using a regular expression, count the number of occurrences of each log entry, and print out the results.

Note that log files may contain sensitive information, and it is important to handle them with care. Be sure to follow ethical guidelines and data privacy regulations when working with log files.

This code uses the following module:

"re"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Password Strength Tester:

This script tests the strength of passwords based on a set of predefined rules, including minimum length, requirement of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.

To use this script, simply call the "password_strength" function with a password as the argument. The function will return a message indicating whether the password is weak or strong, along with recommendations for how to improve its strength if necessary.

Usage:

Download or clone the password_strength.py file.
Import the password_strength function into your project or script.
Call the password_strength function with a password as the argument.

<!-- Example:

from password_strength import password_strength

password = 'MySecurePassword123!'
result = password_strength(password)
print(result) # output: Password is strong. -->

Customization:

The password strength rules can be customized by editing the rules dictionary in the script. The following rules can be adjusted:

length: minimum password length
lower: password must contain at least one lowercase character
upper: password must contain at least one uppercase character
digit: password must contain at least one digit
special: password must contain at least one special character

Adjusting these rules can help you customize the password strength requirements to your specific needs.

Simple Port Scanner:

This is a simple port scanner written in Python that can be used to scan a range of ports on a specified host.

Installation:

To use this script, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Usage:

To use the port scanner, simply run the script with the following command:

<!-- python port_scanner.py -->

By default, the script will scan the range of ports from 1 to 1024 on the localhost (127.0.0.1). You can customize the host and port range by editing the appropriate variables in the script.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clone the repository or download the image-based-authentication.py file.

Modify the tool_names list with your own set of trading tool names.

Run the script using the following command: python image-based-authentication.py

The script will generate a pattern of shuffled trading tool names and display them to the user.

The user should input the trading tool names in the correct order based on the pattern that was generated.

If the user's input matches the original pattern, the authentication is successful.
